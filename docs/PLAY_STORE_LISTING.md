WHY DASHVOICE?

We built DashVoice because we wanted something that didn't exist: a voice-enabled tablet dashboard for Home Assistant that respects your privacy.

For years, we used Fully Kiosk Browser to display Home Assistant dashboards on wall-mounted tablets. It was great for showing dashboards, but it couldn't do the one thing we really wanted - voice control.

We wanted to say "Hey Jarvis, turn on the lights" and have it just work. No cloud. No monthly fees. No sending our voice to big tech companies.

So we built DashVoice.
